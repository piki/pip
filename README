Pip finds structural and performance bugs in distributed systems by
comparing actual system behavior to expected system behavior. Actual
system behavior is based on program annotations, interposition, or
sniffing -- or some combination of the above. Expected system behavior is
described in an external specification of the system's call graph and
communication protocols.

Pip automatically checks actual behavior against expected behavior and
helps programmers visualize the result to discover the causes of any
unexpected behavior.
