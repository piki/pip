Description: Pip trace file processor
 .
 Pip is a set of debugging tools for distributed systems
 
 Pip is intended for three types of programmers: 1) developers who wish to
 find and fix structural and performance bugs in a distributed system they
 are writing; 2) developers who inherit someone else's system and wish to
 learn about it; 3) operators who wish to monitor a system to confirm that
 it is exhibiting the expected structural and performance behaviors.
