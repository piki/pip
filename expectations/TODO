variables:
make sure locals are flushed at the end of the thread.
integrate them into the search.  this is kind of hard.
fix the reduce/reduce issues.  they stem from the fact that $x=$y can
reduce as a string or as an int.

Optimize db reading more.
Optimize message depth so it's not n^2.

Does recursion work?  Can a called fragment call itself inside a repeat or
xor?

MatchSet optimization: combine [X,T,FC] and [X,F,FC] (ignore the
resources=false) and sequences of [X,R,[N]]-[X,R,[N+M]] (combine into
mandatory and optional futures).

futures: implement done, fix futures-in-fragments

rework accounting of validated, invalidated, and resource-failed paths.

actually require send/recv to arrive at their named target thread classes
hosts
during?
